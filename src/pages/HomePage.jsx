                This project demonstrates the strong link between startup growth
                and the Indian economy through detailed data analysis and
                visualized insights. Our interactive dashboard, built with
                industry-standard technologies and scalable cloud
                infrastructure, provides stakeholders with a clear view of
                trends, regional disparities, funding patterns, and
                sector-specific performances.

                The insights gleaned from this project highlight the critical
                role startups play in driving economic growth, innovation, and
                employment in India. By offering a user-friendly tool for
                real-time monitoring and analysis, we enable investors,
                policymakers, and entrepreneurs to make informed, data-driven
                decisions.
